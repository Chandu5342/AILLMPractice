    "response": "**What is a REST API?**\n\nREST (Representational State of Resource) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's a popular approach for building web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow different systems to communicate with each other over the internet.\n\nREST APIs are based on the following principles:\n\n1. **Resource-based**: APIs are designed around resources, which are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).\n2. **Client-server architecture**: The client and server are separate, with the client making requests to the server.\n3. **Stateless**: Each request from the client to the server contains all the necessary information for processing.\n4. **Cacheable**: Responses from the server can be cached by the client.\n5. **Uniform interface**: All interactions between the client and server follow a uniform interface, which includes HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and resource identifiers.\n\n**Common HTTP Verbs in REST APIs**\n\n1. **GET**: Retrieve a resource.\n2. **POST**: Create a new resource.\n3. **PUT**: Update an existing resource.\n4. **DELETE**: Delete a resource.\n\n**Simple Example in Node.js**\n\nLet's create a simple REST API in Node.js that allows you to store and retrieve books. We'll use the Express.js framework.\n\n**`app.js`**\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n// Middleware to parse JSON requests\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Sample in-memory data store (in a real application, you'd use a database)\nlet books = [\n  { id: 1, title: 'Book 1', author: 'Author 1' },\n  { id: 2, title: 'Book 2', author: 'Author 2' },\n];\n\n// GET /books\napp.get('/books', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(books);\n});\n\n// GET /books/:id\napp.get('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = req.params.id;\n  const book = books.find((book) => book.id === parseInt(id));\n  if (book) {\n    res.json(book);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n\n// POST /books\napp.post('/books', (req, res) => {\n  const newBook = req.body;\n  books.push({ id: books.length + 1, ...newBook });\n  res.json(newBook);\n});\n\n// PUT /books/:id\napp.put('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = req.params.id;\n  const updatedBook = req.body;\n  const bookIndex = books.findIndex((book) => book.id === parseInt(id));\n  if (bookIndex !== -1) {\n    books[bookIndex] = { id, ...updatedBook };\n    res.json(updatedBook);\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n\n// DELETE /books/:id\napp.delete('/books/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = req.params.id;\n  const bookIndex = books.findIndex((book) => book.id === parseInt(id));\n  if (bookIndex !== -1) {\n    books.splice(bookIndex, 1);\n    res.json({ message: 'Book deleted' });\n  } else {\n    res.status(404).json({ error: 'Book not found' });\n  }\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');\n});\n```\n\nYou can test the API using a tool like curl or a REST client like Postman:\n\n* Get all books: `GET http://localhost:3000/books`\n* Get a specific book: `GET http://localhost:3000/books/1`\n* Create a new book: `POST http://localhost:3000/books` with JSON body `{\"title\": \"New Book\", \"author\": \"New Author\"}`\n* Update an existing book: `PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1` with JSON body `{\"title\": \"Updated Book\", \"author\": \"Updated Author\"}`\n* Delete a book: `DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/1`\n\nRemember to replace the `books` array with a real database in a production environment."
